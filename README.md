# Sonos-Ad-Mute
mute Sonos when advertisements are playing

for those who hate ads, this is a way to mute a sonos zone when they are playing.  this works great for free pandora that shows 'advertisement' in the text field for example and the zone mutes based off of this.  ezpz.  no advertisement in the text field, no mute, womp womp.  Can be easily replicated across all of your sonos zones
